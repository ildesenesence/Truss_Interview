# Truss Software Engineering Interview

## Introduction and expectations

Hi there! Please choose *one* of the problems described below. Solve to the best of
your ability, using the tools you're most comfortable with. Assume
you're sending your submission in for code review from peers;
we'll be talking about your submission in your interview in that
context. **Be sure to click through to the problem descriptions and read the requirements carefully.**

We expect this to take less than 4 hours of actual coding time. Please
submit a working but incomplete solution instead of spending more time
on it. We're also aware that getting after-hours coding time can be
challenging; we'd like a submission within a week and if you need more
time please let us know.

## How to submit your response

Please submit your solution by emailing a link to [hiring@truss.works](mailto:hiring@truss.works). More details on what we are looking for are included in each problem description linked to below.
