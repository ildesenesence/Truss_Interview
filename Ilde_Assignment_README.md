## Assumptions
This guide assumes `python` (or `python3`) is installed in /usr/bin. This was written on a system running python 3.8.10.

## Set up
1. Install the requirements with `pip`, `pip3`, or `pipenv`. 

## Running the normalizer
The normalizer takes a path to an input (csv) file, and a path to an output file, if the output file does not exist, it will make one.
The syntax for running it is as follows:
> `./BureauOfNormalcy.py <infile> <outfile>`
